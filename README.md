# Login_Page
Designing a login page using Django involves creating a user interface that allows users to authenticate and access the secured areas of a website or web application. Django, a Python web framework, provides built-in authentication and authorization features that simplify the process of designing and implementing a login page. As I was getting to grips with Django programming language, I attempted to design a login page.The basic steps that it included were:-                   

a) I begun by installing Django and creating a new Django project using the django-admin startproject command. Set up the necessary database configurations and create a new Django app using the python manage.py startapp command.

b) Customizing the user model.

c) Define the necessary URLs for the login page in the app's urls.py file. This includes mapping the URL pattern for the login page to a corresponding view.

d) The views.py file should render the login form on GET request and handle the authentication on POST request. Django provides the django.contrib.auth.views module, which includes pre-built views for login, logout, and password reset.

e)Design the HTML template for the login page using Django's template engine. The template should include a form that collects the user's username/email and password.

f)  In the login view, authenticate the user using Django's authentication framework. If the credentials are valid, log the user in using the login() function. If the credentials are invalid, display appropriate error messages.

g)  After successful authentication, redirect the user to the desired page, such as the home page.
